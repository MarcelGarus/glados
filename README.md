# Welcome to the Glados repository!

This repository contains the `glados` core package, a property-based testing framework for Dart.
For a general introduction, check out the [pub.dev page](https://pub.dev/packages/glados).

It also contains several glados-based packages for testing with types of third-party packages.
If you create generators for third-party libraries, but you're unsure whether you want to maintain it, don't hesitate to file a PR; I can take care of publishing it, and the community can more easily find and improve it.

Currently, this repo contains the following packages for third-party libraries:

- `tuple_glados`
